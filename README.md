This is the final project for computer science.
### How to play:
Your goal is to kill all of the enemies that spawn

use WASD or arrow keys to move, and click with the mouse to attack enemies.

The enemies will spawn faster as the game progresses, until either you die, or you kill all of them once they stop spawning
